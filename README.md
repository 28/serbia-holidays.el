Download this file and load in Emacs, or place it somewhere where Emacs
will pick it up.

There are two lists, Serbia public holidays and Serbian slava days.
To replace all holidays with Serbia public ones:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq calendar-holidays holiday-serbia-holidays)
```
 
To replace with both public holidays and slava days:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq calendar-holidays (append holiday-serbia-holidays holiday-serbia-slava-days))
```

To append to existing holidays:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq calendar-holidays (append calendar-holidays holiday-serbia-holidays))
```

Or:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq calendar-holidays (append calendar-holidays holiday-serbia-holidays holiday-serbia-slava-days))
```

Both lists come in Serbian language (Cyrillic) format: `holiday-serbia-holidays-sr` and `holiday-serbia-slava-days-sr`.
